\section{Conclusions and perspectives}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced a new technique that combines static analysis and dynamic analysis with the help of machine learning techniques, in order to ensure the correct execution of software systems. 
Experimental results show that it is possible to learn reachability of bad behaviors by only exploring part of the system. 
For future work, we consider several directions. 
First, we plan to study more expressive properties (e.g., liveness). Second, we consider to generate a partial state semantics, and hence, allow to automatically generate multi-threaded implementations. Third, we consider to generate decentralized policies to facilitate the generation of efficient distributed implementations.
